# Dreamweave Resources

This repository contains a selection of shader mods which typically cannot be preinstalled due to requiring edits to OpenMW's core resources. Dreamweave modlists accomplish this by utilizing advanced features of OpenMW.cfg.

The following are bundled in DW-Resources:

- Components of OpenMW, specifically the `resources` directory shipped in Linux builds (they are not platform-specific)
- [Wareya's PBR shader](https://github.com/wareya/OpenMW-PBR/tree/main)
- [Wareya's OpenMW Shaders](https://github.com/wareya/OpenMW-Shaders/tree/main)

Licenses for bundled content allow for redistribution. Zero modifications are made to ANY of the source files, they are simply repackaged and bundled here for your convenience and ease of use.

Please also be aware that this is a configuration designed for high-end machines - if you don't have some GPU headroom to spare, do not use this resource pack.
Speaking of GPU headroom, the [Morrowind Watercolor HD Upscale](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/56990) and [Tamriel Data and OAAB Watercolor Upscale](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/57094) are both highly recommended for use with this module for consistency, beauty, and further ease of use.
