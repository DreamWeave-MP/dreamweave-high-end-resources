# Dreamweave Resources

This repository contains a selection of shader mods which typically cannot be preinstalled due to requiring edits to OpenMW's core resources. Dreamweave modlists accomplish this by utilizing advanced features of OpenMW.cfg.

The following are bundled in DW-Resources:

- Components of OpenMW, specifically the `resources` directory shipped in Linux builds (they are not platform-specific)
- [Wareya's PBR shader](https://github.com/wareya/OpenMW-PBR/tree/main)
- [Wareya's OpenMW Shaders](https://github.com/wareya/OpenMW-Shaders/tree/main)

Licenses for bundled content allow for redistribution. Wareya's shader packages are unmodified save for the renaming of readme and license files for uniqueness.

The only functional modification to any of the contents of this archive, is the automation of changes to `water.frag` as suggested by `Wareya's OpenMW Shaders`, for the purposes of using their screenspace water reflections. Variants with and without this change are made available.

While this resource pack was originally intended exclusively for high end machines running wareya's PBR shaders, it is now intended to provide clean resource directories with optional improved shaders for everyone's ease of use. However, PBR archives are available if you've got the GPU headroom.

Speaking of GPU headroom, the [Morrowind Watercolor HD Upscale](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/56990) and [Tamriel Data and OAAB Watercolor Upscale](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/57094) are both highly recommended for use with PBR variants of this module for consistency, beauty, and further ease of use.
